test/fixtures/missing-instance/Foo.hs:3:12: error: [GHC-39999]
    • No instance for `Eq (IO ())'
        arising from the first field of `Bar' (type `IO ()')
      Possible fix:
        use a standalone 'deriving instance' declaration,
          so you can specify the instance context yourself
    • When deriving the instance for (Eq Bar)
