fixtures/term-level-use-of-type-constructor/Foo.hs:3:7: error: [GHC-01928]
    • Data constructor out of scope: ‘Foo’.
      NB: the type constructor ‘Foo’ cannot appear in this position.
    • In the expression: Foo
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = Foo
    Suggested fix:
      Perhaps use one of these:
        variable ‘foo’ (line 3), ‘Fooa’ (line 2), ‘Fooi’ (line 2)
